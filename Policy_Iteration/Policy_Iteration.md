# Policy Iteration

Definition (Copilot) (Policy) - A policy is a mapping from states to actions. A policy is deterministic if it maps each state to a single action. A policy is stochastic if it maps each state to a probability distribution over actions.

Definition Bandits (Policy) - Given an action space $/mathcal{A_{t}}$, for each time $t$, the policy of an agent is a probability kernel $/pi_{t}$. 

Definition RL (Policy) - A policy defines the learning agent's way of behaving at a given time. Is a mapping from perceived states of the environment to actions to be taken when in those states.
